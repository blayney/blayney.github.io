<p>I have experience in Java (including FX GUI building and multithreading), C++, C#, C (standalone and for Arduino), SystemVerilog, Python (numpy, a little bit of nmigen), HTML / CSS / JS / WP / Hugo, Git on Gitlab + Github, the Sims 4 with all the DLC, a bit of RISC-V ASM, Wireshark and nmap, SQL, vim (nvim!), Swift and XCode Storyboarding, Unity, Verilator, some WPF / VB.net GUI building, Vivado, and Arduino IDE.</p>
<p>Examples of most of these can be found on my Github. I&rsquo;m focussing on getting comfortable with the C++, RISC-V ASM, Verilator and Vivado workflow at the moment, and aim to specialize in this stack as much as possible.</p>
<p>I have some experience working with RFID / NFC Mifare systems, using Arduino to control and analyse these systems.</p>
<p>Some projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>a basic iOS app with developer capabilities, using Swift storyboarding.</li>
<li>a simulator in Unity / C# that simulates the Fetch Execute Decode cycle</li>
<li>an access control system using NFC / Arduino</li>
<li>a basic CPU with some working bitwise opcodes in SysVerilog and an FPGA // WIP</li>
<li>a simple database interface app in Java that allows a user to edit SQL tables through Derby drivers and an FX GUI</li>
<li>a windows forms app that let&rsquo;s you map connections between components in an audio system, for designing complex routing IO planning // WIP</li>
<li>a series of C++ formal and informal verification testbenches for checking pipeline + instruction implementation on an FPGA // WIP</li>
<li>a C++ app that generates verification structures based on an inputted list of ports, inputs and expected outputs // WIP</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="live-sound-system-tech-and-dsp">Live Sound, System Tech and DSP<a href="#live-sound-system-tech-and-dsp" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I have experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>operating mixing consoles from companies like DiGiCo (D, SD T, Quantum T and S series), Yamaha (QL and CL series), Midas (Pro and M series), on concert and musical theatre productions. I&rsquo;m interested in the real-time DSP engines in these systems, particularly deploying DSP on FPGAs - I have an understanding of the basic maths behind FIR filters (Fourier / FFT, Impulse -&gt; Frequency responses), and FIR filter design, particularly in digital systems. I have played around with FIR design in MatLab and FIR Designer, and am currently figuring out simulink deployment of these designs onto hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setting up PA systems, using SMAART to fix problems in time and frequency domains, and using software like D&amp;B ArrayCalc to design and calibrate arrays. I have designed and helped install PA systems at Reigate College, as well as AES50 audio transport networks to replace an analog system in place before I arrived, which made setting up for productions easier, and operating more stable. I also designed a OSC control network allowing QLab events to control and be controlled by MIDI synthesizers and ETC lighting systems, effectively building an interface between the production timecode system and the MIDI network on stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, Ableton Live, QLab, Waves Multirack and Soundgrid, Reaper and Cities: Skylines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>operating lighting systems running ETC Gio and Ion xe / Element consoles, including timecode, and can build showfiles and magic sheets for these systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mixing in live environments, and a little bit in studio too. In a musical theatre setting, I have built and operated showfiles using automated CG assigment and &lsquo;line-by-line&rsquo; operation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and an understanding of MADI, Dante and AES50 audio transport networks, in designing and setting up systems running these. I have built and tested complex MADI networks around DiGiCo SD racks, SD console to console and Orange box interfaces. In terms of Dante, I have a Level 2 Audinate certification and have built console to RIO networks around a QL5, and have used DVS and Dante Controller to maintain and route systems. I have built AES50 networks and can exploit network topologies for certain system objectives such as multi-console FOH-Monitor systems.</p>
<h1 id="work-experience">Work Experience<a href="#work-experience" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>In summer 2019, I interned in DiGiCo&rsquo;s R&amp;D department, testing various console and transport network systems. While I was there, I shadowed DSP engineers and learned about the FPGA / embedded DSP system development / deployment cycle, and gained experience working in an R&amp;D lab. They were all very kind with their time, and helped put me on the right track in learning DSP for FPGAs, digital FIR filter design and audio effects.</p>
<p>In summer 2018, I completed an internship with Autograph Sound on Little Shop of Horrors at Regents Park, where I shadowed sound designer Nick Lidster and A1 James Hassett running a DiGiCo / MLA rig.</p>
<p>Since 2017, I have worked with a number of bands as a freelance live sound engineer, mixing FOH rock, soul / gospel, jazz and weird out of time synth music.</p>
