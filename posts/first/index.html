<p>I&rsquo;m going to deploy onto a CMOD A7, which is effectively a breadboardable development board built around a Xilinx Artix 7 with USB JTAG + UART, some SRAM, Quad-SPI flash allowing me to save the configuration on the board instead of bitstreaming every time the device powercycles, and some IO like buttons and LEDs which make testing easier.</p>
