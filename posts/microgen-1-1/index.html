        <p><em>I&rsquo;m working on a device that needs to manage a few RAM chips and run some basic programs, with the capabilities being upgraded over time after the board has been assembled. This calls for deployment on an FPGA, but setting up a simple softcore CPU would mean I don&rsquo;t have to create an entirely new ISA or do much hard work thinking up a way to build an FPGA MMU, I just have to build the microarchitecture, which is microgen-1.</em></p>
<p>We need some building block microinstructions to work from, to start putting together some microprograms for some opcodes. These microinstructions work inside the microengine, which has its own microinstruction pointer, and control store where these instructions are held. It has the ability to iterate through these microprograms by incrementing the microinstruction pointer, but also needs to be able to jump to specific points in the control store to execute microroutines. It has a stack on which it can call these microprograms, and pop them when they&rsquo;re done, and some basic ALU operations like increment and or. All the &ldquo;ALU&rdquo; instructions from the instruction set are actually sent through this microALU, or uALU.</p>
<p>The basic microinstruction set looks like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Opcode</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Logic</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NOP</td>
<td>No op</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INC</td>
<td>Increments the current address</td>
<td>Sets the next address to the current address + 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JMP</td>
<td>Loads load address into current address</td>
<td>sets next address to the load address, basically  calling without creating a stack frame</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CALL</td>
<td>Creates stack frame</td>
<td>sets next stack frame&rsquo;s address at the stack pointer  to current address + 1, sets next stack pointer to  stack pointer + 1, and sets next address to the load  address effectively jumping into the routine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RET</td>
<td>Drops stack frame and returns to return address</td>
<td>sets the next address to the return address by looking  at the value stored in the call stack at location stack  pointer - 1, and then sets the next stack pointer  to the stack pointer - 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JNZ</td>
<td>Jumps to load address if value at IP is not zero, if  so increments</td>
<td>sets the next address to load address if the zero flag is  low, increments if the zero flag is high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RST</td>
<td>Resets current address to 0, ignores load address</td>
<td>sets next address to 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A clock is also defined - when a posedge is detected, the following happens:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-SystemVerilog" data-lang="SystemVerilog"><span style="color:#66d9ef">always_ff</span> @(<span style="color:#66d9ef">posedge</span> clock) <span style="color:#66d9ef">begin</span>
	current_addr <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> next_addr;
	current_stack_ptr <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> next_stack_ptr;
	stack <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> next_stack;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span> <span style="color:#75715e">//always_ff
</span></code></pre></div><p>Which moves all the values onto their &ldquo;next&rdquo; iterated versions at the end of that clock cycle.</p>
<p>I may have to add to this set and functionality as more instructions from the ISA are added, but for now, I will start to build the bitwise operations and fetch execute cycle with just these uInstructions.</p>
